//to make the bones of this caluclator i'm thinking i might have to use a canvas like in the Build A Game project, use flexbox for the layout of buttons, use some event listeners for clicks, some functions to manipulate the inputs behind the scenes, and somehow return or console.log the result of our inputs to that one bar.
// making the canvas (the actual space of the calculator)
// make a span that the DOM would print into (**span-id-"results")
let canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
